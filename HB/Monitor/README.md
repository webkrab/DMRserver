**Socket-Based Reporting for HBlink**

Over the years, the biggest request recevied for HBlink (other than call-routing/bridging tools) has been web-based diagnostics and/or statistics for the program.

I strongly disagree with including the amount of overhead this would require inside HBlink -- which still runs nicely on very modest resources. That it does this, and is in Python is a point of pride for me... Just let me have this one, ok? What I have done is added some hooks to HBlink, which will be expanded over time, whereby it listens on a TCP socket and provides the raw data necessary for a "web dashboard", or really any external logging or statistics gathering program.

HBmonitor is my take on a "web dashboard" for HBlink.

***THIS SOFTWARE IS VERY, VERY NEW***

Right now, I'm just getting into how this should work, what does work well, what does not... and I am NOT a web applications programmer, so yeah, that javascript stuff is gonna look bad. Know what you're doing? Help me!

It has now reached a point where folks who know what they're doing can probably make it work reasonably well, so I'm opening up the project to the public.

***GOALS OF THE PROJECT***

Some things I'm going to stick to pretty closely. Here they are:

+ HBmonitor be one process that includes a webserver
+ Websockets are used for pushing data to the browser - no long-polling, etc.
+ Does not provide data that's easily misunderstood
